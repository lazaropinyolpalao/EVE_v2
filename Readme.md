This is the project made by L치zaro Pi침ol and Ignacio Sempere for the subject of "Programaci칩n de Motores Gr치ficos"

In order to execute the demos, you'll need to enter the folder "tools" and execute, in this order:

-build_deps.bat  
-compile_2019.bat / compile_2022.bat (Depending on the version of Visual Studio you use)

Then, you have to go to the previous folder, and the solution to the projects will be there.

In that solution, and in order to test the demos, you first need to build the first project, titled "CompiledLibs".

That will assemble the static library that all the other projects relay on.

After that, you can try any of the other demos that solution has.

Please enjoy.
