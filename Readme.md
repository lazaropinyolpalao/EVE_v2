This is the v2 of the original EVE engine project made alongside Ignacio Sempere Santoja for the subject "Graphic Engine Programming" at ESAT

In this v2 I'll add the features that either we didn't have time or couldn't figure out at the time

This version will be done by myself and it's objective is to learn and to better design the already done engine
